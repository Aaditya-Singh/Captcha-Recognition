# Captcha-Recognition using Machine Learning
In this project, I tried to identify the distinguishable alphabets present in a captcha filled with obfuscating lines using traditional machine learning. I performed dilation (open-cv) for removing the lines, breadth first search for alphabet segmentation, and alphabet classification using linear and kernel support vector machines (SVM). The code is written in Python-3 using Scikit-Learn library.
